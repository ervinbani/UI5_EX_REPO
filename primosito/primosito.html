        Fragments are light-weight UI parts (UI subtrees) which can be reused but do not have any
         controller. This means, whenever you want to define a certain part of your UI to be reusable
          across multiple views, or when you want to exchange some parts of a view against one
           another under certain circumstances (different user roles, edit mode vs read-only mode),
            a fragment is a good candidate, especially where no additional controller logic is 
            required.

        A fragment can consist of 1 to n controls. At runtime, fragments placed in a view behave
         similar to "normal" view content, which means controls inside the fragment will just be
          included into the viewâ€™s DOM when rendered. There are of course controls that are not
           designed to become part of a view, for example, dialogs.
        
        But even for these controls, fragments can be particularly useful, as you will see
         in a minute.
        
        We will now add a dialog to our app. Dialogs are special, because they open on top 
        of the regular app content and thus do not belong to a specific view. That means
         the dialog must be instantiated somewhere in the controller code, but since we want 
         to stick with the declarative approach and create reusable artifacts to be as flexible
          as possible, and because dialogs cannot be specified as views, we will create an
